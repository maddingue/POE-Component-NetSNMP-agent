=head1 NAME

POE::Component::NetSNMP::agent - AgentX clients with NetSNMP::agent and POE


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a thin wrapper around C<NetSNMP::agent> to use it within
a POE-based program, its basic use being the same as you would do
without POE: C<register> one or more OIDs with their associated callbacks.

C<POE::Component::NetSNMP::agent> also provides a simpler mechanism,
similar to C<SNMP::Extension::PassPersist>, if you just want to handle
C<get> and C<getnext> requests over an OID tree: set the C<Autohandle>
option to the a OID, then add OID entries with C<add_oid_entry> or
C<add_oid_tree>.

Note that most of the API is available both as POE events and as object
methods.

This module can use C<Sort::Key::OID> when it is available, for sorting
OIDs faster than with the internal pure Perl function.
