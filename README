NAME

    POE::Component::NetSNMP::agent - AgentX clients with NetSNMP::agent and POE


DESCRIPTION

    This module is a thin wrapper around C<NetSNMP::agent> to use it within
    a POE-based program, its basic use being the same as you would do
    without POE: C<register> one or more OIDs with their associated callbacks.

    C<POE::Component::NetSNMP::agent> also provides a simpler mechanism,
    similar to C<SNMP::Extension::PassPersist>, if you just want to handle
    C<get> and C<getnext> requests over an OID tree: set the C<Autohandle>
    option to the a OID, then add OID entries with C<add_oid_entry> or
    C<add_oid_tree>.

    Note that most of the API is available both as POE events and as object
    methods.

    This module can use C<Sort::Key::OID> when it is available, for sorting
    OIDs faster than with the internal pure Perl function.
